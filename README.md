ASSIGNMENT: Developing a Research Question and Creating Your Personal Code Book

The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth) is a representative school-based survey of adolescents in grades 7-12 in the United States. The Wave 1 survey focuses on factors that may influence adolescents’ health and risk behaviors.

## selected a data set
After looking through the codebook for the Adolescent Health, I have decided that I am particularly interested in "Relations with Parents". I am not sure which variables I will use, so for now I will include all of the relevant variables in my personal codebook.

Since I am actively involved for father's school and teenagers as my kids. I am interested in how the relations with parents impacted adolescents' health and risk behaviors. It will helpful to understand and guide teens. 

##  research question and hypothesis
I am interested in what kind of behavior (or variable) has strong correlation with adolescents' risk behaviors.
My hypothesis : less relationship or less spending time will give higher risk behaviors.

## literature review
search term: "Relations with Parents", "influence adolescents’ health and risk behaviors"
summary of findings: There are some journal papers about the parent's relationship and adolescents. 
The most of them is sexual risk behavior
